Infatti, in un sistema finanziario basato sulle banche, le istituzioni finanziarie centrali (IFC) svolgono un ruolo cruciale nella gestione del rischio, fornendo liquidità e stabilità al sistema. In una struttura più orientata al mercato, il ruolo delle IFC è ridotto e il rischio è più diffuso tra i diversi intermediari finanziari.

Negli Stati Uniti, dal 1934 fino alla crisi del 2007, non si sono verificati episodi di panico bancario grazie a una regolamentazione efficace e all'assicurazione sui depositi. Questa affermazione è vera, poiché la regolamentazione e l'assicurazione sui depositi hanno contribuito a mantenere la stabilità del sistema bancario.\\n3. Durante un episodio di panico bancario, i depositanti sono in genere più preoccupati per la stabilità della propria banca che per la salute generale del sistema bancario.

Secondo questo modello, il rendimento atteso di un portafoglio è inversamente proporzionale al suo livello di rischio.

Gli investimenti sono un fattore importante per spiegare i rendimenti degli investimenti, poiché le aziende che investono in modo massiccio tendono a presentare rendimenti medi più bassi rispetto a quelle che non investono.

In effetti, i fondi comuni di investimento che hanno avuto buoni rendimenti in un periodo breve sono più probabili di essere selezionati dagli investitori, il che può portare a una maggiore richiesta e a un aumento dei prezzi dei titoli azionari inclusi nel portafoglio. Al contrario, i fondi comuni di investimento che hanno avuto cattivi rendimenti sono più probabili di essere abbandonati dagli investitori, il che può portare a una maggiore offerta e a un calo dei prezzi dei titoli azionari inclusi nel portafoglio.

Le aziende con un ampio margine finanziario potrebbero non investire sempre in progetti con NPV positivo, indipendentemente dalle loro opzioni di finanziamento esterno, poiché potrebbero scegliere di investire in progetti con un ritorno più alto, anche se non hanno NPV positivo. Quindi, affermazione 3 è falsa.\\n4. Gli investitori non sono sempre informati sul valore reale delle attività e delle opportunità di investimento di un'azienda, il che comporta che l'emissione di nuove azioni possa comportare una perdita di valore dell'azienda.

Ciò suggerisce che ci sia stato un aumento significativo degli utili non distribuiti, ma anche una riduzione più significativa. La riduzione degli utili non distribuiti è stata causata principalmente dall'utile dell'esercizio, che è aumentato da -242.432 HUF a -1.471.923 HUF tra il 2018 e il 2019.

Il sistema bancario ombra si riferisce a una rete di istituti finanziari che operano al di fuori del controllo regolatorio tradizionale, offrendo prestiti a soggetti con crediti dubbi e creando un mercato secondario per le cartolarizzazioni del debito. Questo sistema ha permesso alle banche di trasferire i rischi a terzi, creando un senso di sicurezza illusoria e incentivando la speculazione.\\n\\nIl sistema bancario ombra è stato in grado di offrire prestiti a soggetti con crediti dubbi grazie alla creazione di strumenti finanziari complessi, come le cartolarizzazioni del debito, che hanno permesso di trasferire i rischi a terzi.

Le opzioni B e C sono meno probabili, poiché l'aumento della soddisfazione degli azionisti non è necessariamente correlato all'emissione di debito e l'aumento della concorrenza tra gli istituti di credito può portare a una maggiore disponibilità ad accettare limiti di prestito aziendali più elevati, ma non necessariamente a una riduzione dei prestiti.

Questa affermazione è vera, poiché le leggi sul lavoro della Cina sono state implementate per migliorare la protezione dei diritti dei lavoratori e aumentare la loro rappresentanza.\\n2. Leggi più severe in materia di licenziamento possono inavvertitamente portare a un calo dei tassi di assunzione, poiché le aziende potrebbero essere riluttanti ad assumere lavoratori a causa dell'aumento dei costi di licenziamento. Questa affermazione è vera, poiché le leggi più severe in materia di licenziamento possono aumentare i costi per le aziende e renderle più riluttanti ad assumere lavoratori.\\n3. Il governo fornisce tipicamente un'assicurazione contro la disoccupazione perché è in grado di gestire meglio degli assicuratori privati i rischi finanziari inerenti alla presentazione simultanea di richieste di indennizzo di importo elevato durante le recessioni.

La struttura temporale dei rendimenti delle obbligazioni societarie non ha un potere predittivo significativo per i rendimenti azionari futuri: questa affermazione è vera, poiché la struttura dei rendimenti delle obbligazioni è influenzata da fattori come la domanda di liquidezza e la politica monetaria, che possono variare nel tempo.\\n3. La pendenza del CDS può prevedere i rendimenti azionari indipendentemente da vari fattori di rischio tradizionali, come il beta e i livelli di rating creditizio: questa affermazione è vera, poiché la pendenza del CDS è un indicatore del rischio di insolvenza e può influenzare i rendimenti azionari indipendentemente dai fattori di rischio tradizionali.\\n4. Una struttura dei termini di credito più ripida è indicativa di un aumento previsto del rischio di insolvenza e riduce le previsioni di redditività futura: questa affermazione è vera, poiché una struttura dei termini di credito più ripida indica una maggiore incertezza e un aumento del rischio di insolvenza.\\n\\nTuttavia, la domanda chiede di identificare le affermazioni FALSE.

L'affermazione 2 è falsa perché un'offerta di lavoro relativamente anelastica significa che le variazioni salariali non comportano un forte cambiamento nella disoccupazione.\\n3. L'affermazione 3 è vera perché l'elasticità della domanda di lavoro determina l'entità della variazione dell'occupazione quando il salario minimo viene aumentato.\\n4. L'affermazione 4 è falsa perché un salario minimo più elevato può effettivamente ridurre la disoccupazione, poiché può aumentare la domanda di lavoro e ridurre la concorrenza per i posti di lavoro.\\n5. L'affermazione 5 è falsa perché un aumento del salario minimo reale non porta sempre a un aumento dell'occupazione totale.

Quando gli individui intraprendono transazioni economiche volontarie, generalmente lo fanno perché costretti da fattori esterni e normative. Questa affermazione è falsa, poiché le transazioni economiche volontarie sono spesso motivate da scelte individuali e non da fattori esterni o normativi.\\n3.

In questo contesto, le persone e le imprese sono meno propense a prendere in prestitto denaro a un tasso di interesse più alto, poiché il denaro può essere investito in attività più redditizie. Inoltre, gli investitori possono essere meno propensi a prestare denaro a un tasso di interesse più alto, poiché il denaro può essere investito in attività alternative più redditizie.

In un mercato con due aziende concorrenti, l'equilibrio di Nash si raggiunge quando nessuna azienda può migliorare il proprio risultato senza che l'altra azienda reagisca cambiando la propria strategia. In questo contesto, la determinazione dei prezzi è una strategia fondamentale per le aziende per raggiungere l'obiettivo di massimizzare i profitti.\\n\\nNel caso di un mercato con due aziende concorrenti, l'equilibrio di Nash influenza la strategia di determinazione dei prezzi in modo tale che le aziende tendono a fissare prezzi che siano ottimi rispetto alle loro strategie individuali.

In una recessione, le aziende potrebbero essere più propense a licenziare lavoratori anziché aumentare i salari.\\n2. La disoccupazione involontaria si verifica quando i lavoratori sono disposti a lavorare ma non riescono a trovare un impiego al livello salariale prevalente: vero. La disoccupazione involontaria è un concetto chiave nella teoria del mercato del lavoro e si verifica quando i lavoratori sono disposti a lavorare ma non riescono a trovare un impiego a causa di salari troppo alti o di altre ragioni.\\n3.
